# What's Rcoin?
It's a toy project that I started to learn rust and learn about bitcoin at the same time. The goal was to read about bitcoin from different resources, and implement those things as much as possible in rust.

Some of the resources I used includes:
- https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook
- https://learnmeabitcoin.com
- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script

## TODOs
- [x] miner can create a coinbase transaction.
- [ ] node writes in ~/.rcoin/blk.dat
- [ ] node starts from genesis, or the content of ~/.rcoin/blk.dat
- [ ] wallet can post a transaction referencing an existing utxo in the blockchain.
